BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
------------------
Ok, so since we don't have a server yet, I'm precompiling our templates. You need mustache for that, so start with
```
gem install [--user-install] mustache
```

Then  git clone  this repo, cd into it, and run (1) a static server and (2) the build script:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer&
./build.sh
```
